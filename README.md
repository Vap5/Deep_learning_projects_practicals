# Deep_learning_projects_practicals

Go to practical 4 in pynb file
The file contains many projects and practicals other than malaria cell classification 

Steps for Malatria cell classification:
1. Dataset is collected from kaggle via API
2. Dataset extraction on google colab
3. Creating training and test directories using the image dataset
4. use cv2 for reading image files using their respective paths
5. Use image data generator from tensorflow for image preprocessing
6. sequential model is used.
7. layers such as CNN-Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout is used and then stacked layers are created
8. Model training and validation
9. Model testing and prediction of values.
